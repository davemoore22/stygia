GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

This game is Stygia, my entry in the 2011 Seven-Day Roguelike Competition (7DRL).

I started coding* at 6pm on Sunday 6th March 2011, and this version was compiled at 5.54pm on Suunday 13th March 2011, 167 hours and 54 minutes later.

It is a complete and playable game, although I'm sure there are many bugs present, as I did not have time to playtest it properly.

To get key/control information, press ? on starting a new game.

I intend to continue do develop this game after the 7DRL is over, although this version will always stand alone as is.

This program and code is released under the GPL v2 license, and is (c) Dave Moore 2011

Stygia was written in C# using the Libtcod library and using Visual Studio 2010.

If you have any questions about this software, or bug reports, or play reports, I'd love to hear from you: you can contact me via email at starbog@gmail.com or I am on the #rgrd channel sometimes as "starbog".

I'd like to thank jice and chris harmon for Libtcod and the Libtcod.NET port respectively. Without either of them, this game would not have been possible.

This version of the code was compiled using, and requires v4 of the Microsoft .NET Framework to run. Eventually, I hope to port this code to Linux using the Mono framework.

CODE STUFF
==========

Inside the code subdirectory is the VS project for this program. I've removed the files that come with the Libtcod.NET distribution, but they will be present in the Solution Explorer - just copy the appropriate files into the Stygia directory and you should be fine.

Yes, the code isn't particularily well written: it is my first serious application written in C#, and I will in the future be refactoring it completely. It works (mostly) and that's the important bit.

*Prior to the commencement of the competition, I had a title screen and a @ walking around a map. All the other code has been written during the course of the 7DRL week.
